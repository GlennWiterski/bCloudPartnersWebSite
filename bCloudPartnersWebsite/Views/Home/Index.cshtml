                    There is not a day that goes by where you do not hear the term "Cloud Computing". You are swamped with advertisements, misinformation, and promises of incredible savings.
                    You have little or no "real world implementation experience" and are trying to sort out fact from fiction. In the end you need answers to some basic questions:
