                    There is not a day that goes by where you do not hear the terms "blockchain","distributed ledger", ICO or smart contract. You are swamped with advertisements, misinformation, and promises.
                    You have little or no "real world implementation experience" and are trying to sort out fact from fiction. In the end you are really looking for answers to some basic
                    questions:

                    <br />
                    Does the cloud make sense for my organization ?
                    <br />
                    Does a private or public blockchain make sense for my company and our business partners ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What is a Blockchain application and how is it different for a normal "app" ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What tools do i need to create a blockchain and what does it cost ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Can i host my blockchain app on Azure, AWS or Google Cloud ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What coins do need to purchase ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What is an ICO and why are there so many ?
