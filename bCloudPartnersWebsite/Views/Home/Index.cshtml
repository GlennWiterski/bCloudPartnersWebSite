                    There is not a day that goes by where you do not hear the term "Cloud Computing" or "Blockchain". You are swamped with advertisements, misinformation, and promises.
                    You have little or no "real world implementation experience" and are trying to sort out fact from fiction. In the end you are really looking for answers to some basic
                    questions:

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Does the Cloud or Blockchain make sense for my company, and can they coexistt up ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What is a Blockchain application ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    How does Blockchain development differ from what i am used to?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    How and what should I move to the Cloud?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Which Cloud provider should I use ? Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ? Amazon AWS ? Microsoft Azure ? Other ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    How much will I save ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    How much will this cost ?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    How do I migrate my current applications and data ?
