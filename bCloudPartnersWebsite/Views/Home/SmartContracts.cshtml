                    The ethereum blockchain gives the developer the ability to write, compile and deploy blocks of code in order to extend the functionality of
                    a blockchain. These blocks of are written using a javascript type language which is later compiled and deployed to a blockchain running in a
                    an existing EVM ( ethereum virtual machine.)

                    <strong>Solidity</strong> is currently the preferred programming language, however Serpent, LLL, and Mutan
                    are also viable options. Solidity source code files contain both the business model definition as well
                    as the processing logic. Here is an example of some solidity code.
